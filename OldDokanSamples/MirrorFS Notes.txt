Important notes:
- Each file's Last-Access-Time is not updated intentionally to reduce amount of operations on file system 
  (could easily be parameterized).
- The error code in "WriteFile" for the "NotSupportedException" exception 
  is not appropriate and should be changed.
- File handles are limited to 31 bits, which could be a problem, 
  but it's good for now (if CreateFile is called 10 times a second, 
  it would take 2,485 days to have a wrap-around).

TODO:
- Handle File Locking
- Rewrite DeleteDirectory exception handling more elegantly
