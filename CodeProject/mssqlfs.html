    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Every time I use Linux, I feel a piece of jealousy to see its filesystems. Not only NTFS, FAT32, but huge
        palette of data storages included GDocs etc. Now I can raise head up! <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/">
        Dokan rocks!</a>
    </p>
    <h2>
        What is Dokan?</h2>
    <p>
        What Dokan is? Simply device driver encapsulated filesystem calls. By using proxy
        functions gives programatically create response for ReadFile, WriteFile, FindFiles
        and other core I/O operations. Even on .NET!  There are also Dokan.NET interface for using C#.<br />
        Now you are enable to write your own filesystems. You can create your own filesystem
        or you can be inspired by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dokan/web/filesystems-using-dokan">
            another applications using Dokan </a>. What about filesystem using memory as
        ramdisk, system used encrypted file as data storage? Mirroring of some disc or directories,
        access to registry via filesystem, list of processes as files on attached disk?
        Open your mind and try to find another use for Dokan. This article will help you.
        You will be able to store your files on MS SQL database, copy, rename, update, delete
        etc. Simply file versioning is also included. This was reason why I started play
        with Dokan. Create external storage with some versioning, mounted as disk, easy
        to use for end users. To create version of file, just add extension ".version" to the end of 
        filename and copy to disk. File will be renamed to previous extension and previous version
        of file receive version number. You can choose if you want to see all versions or only actual
        version. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Prerequisities
    </h2>
    <p>
        Installed <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/">Dokan</a>.
        <br />
        Download actual version (0.53) from Dokan main pages and install. (code was tested with version 0.52)
    </p>
    <p>
        Prepared MS-SQL
        <br />
        For testing purposes is suitable MS-SQL Express edition on your PC, but I used SQL
        server located on virtual machine to simulate some network traffic and network accidents.
        For production be carefull and create special user account and allow to run stored
        procedures for this account. Do not miss this step. It is good security strategy.<br />
        On SQL machine run metadata script to create stored procedures used by C# application
        and create table "DOKANFS", main and only table using by your app. If you want to
        use another table, you have to rename all occurences in all stored procedures.
        <br />
        VS 2008 Standard edition. If you have Express edition, you have to use MS-SQL Express
        on you machine. Express edition doesn`t allow remote connection to MS-SQL server.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Play with code</h2>
    <p>
        Let`s peek into code to find some useful. As you can see files are "pre-loaded"
        into simple <font color="aqua">Dictionary </font>object. Files are loaded from SQL
        database when first ReadFile method call is used to receive datas. File is downloaded
        and "ungzipped" if was gzipped. Files are gzipped when is written on SQL server
        due to reduce network traffic. But if file has extension enlisted, file is not zipped.
        <br />
        File is readed and writed using FileCache objects. When file is closed, using Cleanup
        procedure called by Dokan.NET. Cleanup procedure performs gzipping of data and call
        SP WriteFile to store data into MS-SQL.
    </p>
    <pre>
 public int Cleanup(string filename, DokanFileInfo info)
        {
            lock (FileCache)
            {
                if ((FileCache.ContainsKey(filename) == true) && (FileCache[filename].MemStream.Length > 0))
                {
                    using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
                    {
                        using (SqlCommand Cmd = new SqlCommand())
                        {
                            MemoryStream mem = ((FileCaching)FileCache[filename]).MemStream;
                            Cmd.CommandText = "WriteFile";
                            Cmd.Parameters.Add("@iszipped", SqlDbType.Bit, 1);
                            Cmd.Parameters["@iszipped"].Value = 0;
                            Cmd.Parameters.Add("@OriginalSize", SqlDbType.BigInt);
                            Cmd.Parameters["@OriginalSize"].Value = mem.Length;

                            if (this.ZippedExtension.ToLower().IndexOf(Path.GetExtension(Regex.Split(filename.ToLower(), ".version")[0])) == -1)
                            {
                                if (FileCache[filename].MemStream.Length > 256)
                                {
                                    Cmd.Parameters["@iszipped"].Value = 1;
                                    MemoryStream dummy = new MemoryStream();
                                    Compress(mem, dummy);
                                    mem.SetLength(0);
                                    dummy.WriteTo(mem);
                                }
                            }

                            mem.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
                            Cmd.Parameters.Add("@data", SqlDbType.VarBinary, (int)mem.Length);
                            Cmd.Parameters["@data"].SqlValue = mem.ToArray();

                            Cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@filename", filename);

                            Cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
                            Cmd.Connection = conn;
                            conn.Open();

                            Cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
                            FileCache.Remove(filename);
                        }
                    }
                }
            };
            return DokanNet.DOKAN_SUCCESS;
        }

    <p>
    Code written in T-SQL on MS-SQL is not so complicated. The most complicated stored procedure is FindFiles, due
    using versions.<br />
    Drive to show old version of files or not is set first bit in content field of root directory "\". If is first
    bit set to 1, procedure shows previous version in extension.
    </p>

	SET NOCOUNT ON

    <h2>
        Points of Interest</h2>
    <p>
    Dokan in version 0.52 working great, but there are some unexpected behaviour when file was opened
    by Notepad++. I`m still waiting when Dokan grow to be in use similar to TrueCrypt and its loading
    drivers on demand.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What is missing</h2>
    <p>
        Huge testing on various network. I tested this concept on 1Mbit VPN without any problems.<br />
        This is only proof of concept, no code "beautifier" was aplied.<br />
        Also some "registration" functions can be done.. for example prepare database by create all stored
        procedures, create table etc.<br />
        You can also use Azure, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, Oracle or any database you want to store data<br />
        All code is published as is. I apologize for some inconvenience. Time passing too quickly for me and
        I have other things to do not only this project. <br />
        Enjoy this code and contact me, if you want participate on this project seriously. Some examples
        of cloud using will be nice.
    </p>
    <h2>
        History</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first release, proof of concept.
